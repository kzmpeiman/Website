        <h3>Peiman</h3>
        <p>I'm form Ireland and studied at Beida in Beijing and SOAS in London.
          I have taught English and Math at schools, training centers and
          kindergartens in Beijing prior to Covid-19. I am a certified teacher holding TEFL general and TEFL Advanced
          for kids. As teaching material, I have used Reading Wonders, Great Writing, Reading Explorer, Top Notch Series,
          English Vocabulary in use, as well as interactive games tailored for the specific needs of the kids.

        <h3>Sandy</h3>
        <p>I have Ph.D. from UIBE in Beijing. I am also helping Peiman with his
        classes from China as a Teaching Assistant in case
          there is a language barrier between Peiman and the families. You can talk
          with me in Chinese :))
